The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is drastically changing the lives of people, including the lives of young people. Schools and universities have closed momentarily, exams and events postponed, the usual health information services are limited, socializing with friends and wider family is highly discouraged and in some places even punishable. Living in these circumstances can be tough for young people for their social, physical and mental wellbeing. This study examined the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and identified the factors contributing to psychological impact in the Philippines. During the early phase of the pandemic in the Philippines, one-fourth of respondents reported moderate-to-severe anxiety and one-sixth reported moderate-to-severe depression and psychological impact. The factors identified can be used to devise effective psychological support strategies.<p>

Due to the global pandemic, the schools are forced to shut and cancel all face-to-face classes and meeting as much as possible to prevent the widespread of the virus. Over 1.2 billion students in 186 countries are also forced to stop going to school. Because of this, all education sectors came up with another way to let students learn inside the safety and comforts of their home and this is the e-learning system or the usage of digital and electronic devices to connect with the class as a medium of education as a new normal life it adopted. There are also apps that students are able to connect with the teacher and their other classmates like google meet, zoom, and existing apps like messenger and facebook. In this medium students use cellphones, laptops with the apps to comply to their activities, quizzes and exams. Another way is through modular learning, this is for the students that don’t have the capacity to have the e-learning system. They are given booklets to comply their tasks.<p>
